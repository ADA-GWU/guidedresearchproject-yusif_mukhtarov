## Project Objectives

This research delves into the in-depth analysis of popular deep learning models, including AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet, and EfficientNet, applied to vegetable custom datasets. The study aims to explore and compare the performance of these models, considering a range of performance metrics to ensure an unbiased evaluation. The chosen vegetable datasets are carefully preprocessed, encompassing required image conditions and added noise to simulate real-world scenarios.
To evaluate the models thoroughly, classification accuracy serves as the primary performance metric. Additionally, precision, recall, and F1-Score are incorporated to provide a comprehensive understanding of the models' strengths and weaknesses in handling false positives, false negatives, and overall balanced performance. Furthermore, the research records the time taken for training and prediction phases, along with the number of parameters, to assess the models' efficiency.
